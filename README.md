## Purpose:

This repository was created for our subject **Software Engineering Algorithmic Techniques** in Complutense University of Madrid. 
These were the problems we had to solve on the online judge, lab sessions, and exams. [^1]

There are `12` different themes we learned in this subject, and they are organized by the number on the judge following this pattern:

**There are 2 numbers:**
- The first number corresponds to the theme [(see the different content down below)](#subject-content)
- The second number means just the order in the judge; if there is a 6.1, for example, the 1 just means it was the first one to appear on the judge.

> [!NOTE]
> The second number might not be a number and can be a letter; if the letter is `L`, it means it was a lab exercise, and if it's an `E`, it means it was an exam exercise. 

Each folder also includes the problem `.pdf` file and a `.txt` cases file.

The `.pdf` file is the text of the problem, which usually includes a small introduction story with the problem 
we have to solve, the structure of the entry data, the structure of how the output is supposed to look, and some test cases. 

The `.txt` file contains the test cases for each problem; normally, these are the cases on the problem text, and sometimes there are more cases that we thought of to test the algorithm before uploading it to the judge.

## Subject content:

### 1: Advanced binary search trees (_1 on the judge_)
  - AVL trees and how to implement them.

### 2: Priority queues and heaps (_2 and 3 on the judge_)
  - Priority queues and how to implement them.
  - Variable priority queues `(indexed priority queue)`.
  - Heaps and `heapsort algorithm`.

### 3: Graphs (_4, 5, 6, and 7 on the judge_)
  - Graphs and how to implement them `(Adjacency list and adjacency matrix)`.
  - Directed graphs.
  - Weighted graphs.
  - Directed weighted graph.
  - `Kruskal algorithm`.
  - `Dijkstra algorithm`.

### 4: Disjoint sets (_6 on the judge_)
  - Disjoint sets and how to implement them.

### 5: Amortized analysis (_None on the judge since this is general_)
  - Amortized analysis of the cost in time and cost in space of a function or algorithm.

### 6: Greedy algorithms (_8 and 9 on the judge_)
  - Greedy algorithms and how to know if they are optimal or not.
  - Greedy algorithms used in maximization and minimization problems.

### 7: Dynamic programming (_TODO, todavía no hemos llegado_)
  - TODO
  - TODO

### 8: Brach and bound (_TODO, todavía no hemos llegado_)
