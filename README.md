## Purpose

This repository was created for our subject **Software Engineering Algorithmic Techniques** in Complutense University of Madrid. 
This were the problems we had to solve on the onlinde judge, lab sessions and exams.

There are `(numero de temas diferentes)` different themes we learned in this subject and they are organized by the number on the judge following this pattern:

- The first number corresponds to the theme [(see the different themes down below)](#themes-content)
- The second number means just the order in the judge, if there is a 6.1 for example, the 1 just means it was the first one to a appear on the judge.

> [!NOTE]
> The second number might not be a number and can be a letter, if the letter is `L` it means it was a lab exercise and if it's an `E` it means it was an exam exercise 

## Themes content:

### 1: Advanced binary search trees (1 on the judge)
  - AVL trees and how to implement them

### 2: Priority queues and heaps (2 and 3 on the judge)
  - Priority queues and how to implement them
  - Variable priority queues
  - Heaps and heapsort

### 3: Graphs (4, 5, 6 and 7 on the judge)
  - Graphs and how to implement them (Adjacency list and adjacency matrix)
  - Directed graphs
  - Weighted graphs
  - Directed weighted graph
  - Kruskal
  - Dijkstra

### 4: Disjoint sets (6 on the judge)
  - Disjoint sets and how to implement them

### 5: Amortized analysis (None on the judge since this is general)
  - Amortized analysis of the cost in time and cost in space of a function or algorithm

### 6: Greedy algorithms (8 and 9 on the judge)
  - Greddy algorithms and how to know if they are optimal or not
  - Greddy algorithms used in maximization and minimization problems
