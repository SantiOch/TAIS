## Purpose:

This repository was created for our subject **Software Engineering Algorithmic Techniques** in Complutense University of Madrid. 
These were the problems we had to solve on the online judge, lab sessions, and exams. [^1]

> [!NOTE]
> This is a cloned repository, because I wanted to have it on my profile, if you want to see the original, check [Alex's github profile](https://github.com/AlexBoni97)

There are `12` different themes we learned in this subject, and they are organized by the number on the judge following this pattern:

**There are 2 numbers on each problem:**
- The first number corresponds to the theme [(see the different content down below)](#subject-content)
- The second number means just the order in the judge.

> [!NOTE]
> The second number might not be a number and can be a letter; if the letter is `L`, it means it was a lab exercise, and if it's an `E`, it means it was an exam exercise.
 
> For example, the exercise 6.1 means it is the 6th theme and the first exercise of that theme, the exercise 3.L was the lab exercise of the third theme, and the exercise 6.E was an exam exercise.

Each folder also includes the problem `.pdf` file and a `.txt` cases file.

The `.pdf` file is the text of the problem, which usually includes a small introduction story with the problem 
we have to solve, the structure of the entry data, the structure of how the output is supposed to look, and some test cases. 

The `.txt` file contains the test cases for each problem; normally, these are the cases on the problem text, and sometimes there are more cases that we thought of to test the algorithm before uploading it to the judge.
